update EVENT BioVerify_SubmittedPublication TO USE INDEX (IN SOLIDITY AND ALCHEMY NOTIFY)
===> 	"event BioVerify_SubmittedPublication(address indexed publisher, uint256 indexed publicationId, string cid)",

===

1. Pick "senior reviewer" in fulffilrandomwords
The "Reputation-Weighted" Random Pick
Since we have memberReputationScore, the ideal decentralized way is to pick the Senior Reviewer from the top $X\%$ of the community.How it works: When fulfillRandomWords runs, it doesn't just pick 5 reviewers; it picks 5 + 1. The 6th person is the one with the highest reputation among those picked, or is picked from a separate pool of "Elders."The Alchemy Payload: Alchemy will send a list: reviewers: ["0x1...", "0x2...", "0x3..."] and a separate field seniorReviewer: "0xSenior...".

2. change event BioVerify_Agent_PickedReviewers
- remove requestId and replace with rootCid
- add address seniorReviewer

(IN SOLIDITY AND ALCHEMY NOTIFY)
===> 	"event BioVerify_Agent_PickedReviewers(uint256 indexed publicationId, string rootCid, address[] reviewers, address seniorReviewer, uint256 minValidReviewsCount)",


3.
